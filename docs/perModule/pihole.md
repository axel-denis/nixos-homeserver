# Pi-hole

### Info
> "Network-wide Ad Blocking"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pi-hole is a custom DNS server that block defined domain lists (generally ad or tracking servers).
> For it to work, you need to enable it and configure it here (*control;'s* config), but __also configure your router/device to use it as a DNS (*not* this config)__
>
> See [Pi-hole's "Post-Install" docs](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/post-install/)
>
> As of now, Pi-hole can't be used by the [routing](./routing.md) module (can't expose a domain). If you think that could be useful, please open an issue.
