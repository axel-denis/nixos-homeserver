# Terminal
This module brings some quality of life improvements for your terminal.

## Options

*Note that this modules offers more than one tool and don't have a global `enable` options like the other modules.*

- `enableOhMyZsh` -> uses [(Oh My ZSH)](https://ohmyz.sh/) for your terminal.
  
  -> default: `false`

- `ohMyZshTheme` -> defines the Oh My Zsh theme.
  
  -> default: `robbyrussell`

- `enableNeofetchGreet` -> Will print [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) when you start your terminal. Absolutely useless, but wow how badass it is.
> [!WARNING]
> Only works with ZSH enabled for now
